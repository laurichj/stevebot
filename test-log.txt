Manual Test Results - 2026-01-21

Test Time: [Awaiting hardware testing]
Within Active Window: [To be determined during testing]

Observed Behavior:
- WiFi connection: [Awaiting hardware test]
- NTP sync: [Awaiting hardware test]
- State transition to IDLE: [Awaiting hardware test]
- Misting triggered: [Awaiting hardware test - expected based on window]
- Relay activated: [Awaiting physical verification]
- Timestamp format: [Awaiting hardware test]
- Mist duration: [Awaiting measurement]
- Next mist calculation: [Awaiting hardware test]

Notes:
Implementation complete. All code has been compiled successfully and commits
have been made for all 10 implementation tasks. Hardware testing requires:

1. Physical ESP32 board with relay on pin 13
2. Serial monitor to observe behavior
3. Verification of timing using the commands:
   arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --fqbn esp32:esp32:adafruit_feather_esp32s2 stevebot.ino
   arduino-cli monitor -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -c baudrate=115200

Expected behavior:
- On boot: relay LOW (OFF) for safety
- WiFi connects and NTP syncs
- Log: "Time synchronized, scheduler active"
- If in 9am-6pm window: first mist triggers immediately
- Log: "2026-01-21 HH:MM:SS | MIST START"
- After 25 seconds: "2026-01-21 HH:MM:SS | MIST STOP"
- Log: "2026-01-21 HH:MM:SS | Next mist: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
- Subsequent mists every 2 hours while in 9am-6pm window
